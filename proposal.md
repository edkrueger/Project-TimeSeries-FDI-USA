* Proposed Routes:
    1. Home: Description of the app
    2. Model: Analysis of the dataset, model development, and model selection 
    3. Input: Intaking relevant features/factors of the investing countries for predicting their FDI in USA
    4. Visualization: Plotly visulation with important charts and figures
